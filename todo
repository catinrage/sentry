# TODO

- services: error handling is not efficient at all, for example for checking if a field is unique i send a request to server/
  to check if the record already exists, the better way is to use prisma error system for that, but its also harder to deal with (handle)

- services: some dangerous unhandled throws (findUniqueOrThrow) in some services's findUniqueSafe function

- modules: add some custion mutation for some modules, for example for machines add a mutation to toggle availability and so on...

- modules: maybe a review on comments for graphlq schema's

- dependency injection: when deleing projects for example it checks if project has any stage and if have throws an error, while project shouldn't know about stages

# Ideas

- timeline model: be able to create time lines, each schedule belongs to a timeline, and time lines can be compared
